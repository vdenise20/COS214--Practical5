Component 1:
-Add functions from spec
-removed targetTemperature and just asked for temp as constructor parameter.

Component 2:
-Adapter implemented incorrectly in diagram. Legacy thermostat should be its own class. SmartAdapter should inherit from smart devices. If you want me to explain why, lmk and i'll send you a voicenote.
